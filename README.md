## ðŸŸ¢ Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). The LTS version should be fine. You will also need the `npm` package manager (which comes with Node.js) or `yarn`. A development environment or IDE with TypeScript/JavaScript support will help. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good choice.

## ðŸ“¦ Execution

Clone the repository and then set everything up:

```shell
npm ci
```

The reason for `npm ci` over `npm install` is covered best in this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53325242).

Make sure to install the Playwright browsers:

```shell
npx playwright install
```

Now run the Playwright tests:

```shell
npx playwright test
```

What this does is start up a web server for the application and run the tests. There only happens to be one test because this repo is meant to serve as a starting point to understand how to situate a Playwright test context within a React application.
